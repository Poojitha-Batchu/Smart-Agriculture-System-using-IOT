# Smart-Agriculture-System-using-IOT

Smart Agriculture System using IOT makes use of wireless sensor networks that collects
data from different sensors deployed at various nodes and sends it through the wireless protocol.
This smart agriculture using IOT system is powered by ESP32S, it consists of Temperature sensor,
Moisture sensor, water level sensor, DC motor. When the IOT based agriculture monitoring system
starts it checks the water level, humidity and moisture level. It sends data to SMART
AGRICULTURE APP about the levels. If the soil type is DRY, then it Automatically On the pump
by using App and also Off the pump when the soil is dry. DTH22 sensor senses the temperature and
humidity values.
